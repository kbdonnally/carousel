# Touch-Enabled Thumbnail Carousel Gallery

*NB: Unfinished prototype as of November 2017.*

This repo holds the code for a standalone carousel gallery with minimal external libraries. The layout here requires hard-coded HTML, but is intended for eventual use in an Omeka PHP template; it should be compatible with any similar situation.

The gallery uses Hammer.js to enable touch events; the library makes touch-related actions into verbs friendly to event listeners (e.g. 'pan'). (See their [Github](hammerjs.github.io) for more.)
